# 75 - Sort Colours (_LeetCode_)

> Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
**in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in
the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white,
   and blue, respectively.

The interesting thing about this problem is that it doesn't necessarily
require a typical comparison sort[^1] like how some problems would like.

[^1]: A sort that involves comparing elements relative to each other, which is
mathematically bounded to Î˜(_n log n_). See [Wikpedia]
