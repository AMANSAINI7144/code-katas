# 75 - Sort Colours (_LeetCode_)

> Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
**in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in
the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white,
   and blue, respectively.

The interesting thing about this problem is that it doesn't necessarily
require a typical comparison sort <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>like how some
problems would like.

<b id="f1">1</b> A sort that involves comparing elements relative to each other, which is
mathematically bounded to Θ(_n log n_). See
